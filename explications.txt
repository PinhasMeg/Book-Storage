In this project, I used the MVC method, with postController.js for ontroller.
The data is stored in a localhost count mongo db, and all configurations are in dbConfig.js.

There are 6 APIs, to add update get and delete.
In order to test all the APIs I used the Postman logiciel that help dev to verify the requests.
